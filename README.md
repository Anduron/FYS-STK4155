# FYS3150
This repository will contain all programs works in progress and other dysfunctional files that i create while going through the course FYS3150 Computational Physics



PROJECT 1:
Solving tridiagonal matrices using taylored and general algorithms.

PROJECT 2:
Using Jacobis rotational method to solve scaled ODE's (bucling beam and Schrödinger equation), by finding the eigenvalues of the system.

PROJECT 3:
Using object oriented implementations of Forward Euler and Velocity Verlet to predict planetary orbits.

PROJECT 4:
Using the Metropolis algorithm to simulate the Ising model.

PROJECT 5:
Solving PDE's (Heat Diffusion in one and two dimensions) using implicit and explicit schemes.
